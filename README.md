Instead of creating a static shopping list with paper and a pen, create it dynamically. Take the list item and the price from the user and further find the grand total.

Details:

Two input fields should be displayed that take name and price as input .

A button with id = ”add” with innerText Add should be rendered.

When the add button is clicked, the list should be updated and rendered through a table the column for prices must have id=”price” and the column with item names must have id=”item”

item-name-input and item-price-input should be used as id for name and price input fields.

The grandtotal should be displayed as h3 element with id=”total”

Acceptance criteria:

Input fields should be cleared once the element has been added to the list

Initially, the table should have only one row with grand total as 0.

Implementation of aria-role to the correct tags.

Invalid input should not be accepted.
